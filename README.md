# HeartDiseaseClassify-ML
Heart Disease Dataset Analysis &amp; Classification using  Machine Learning model Linear regression to predict cardiac diseases.

#  heartD-1 Branch
- Machine Learning with Linear Regressions on Heart Disease Dataset.
- Sub-branch of [HeartDiseaseClassify-ML_Main](https://github.com/jubinjacob03/HeartDiseaseClassify-ML/tree/main) branch.
- Files in this Branch -

      HD_Linear-Reg.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with python code.
      Heart Disease.csv: Dataset of Heart Disease in which Machine Learning was performed.
      heartD-1_singlecodefile.py: Single .py file which contains all python codes from notebook file (for easy copying of codes).

# Setup and Running

- Install Any IDE which supports .ipynb and .py format.
- Import the .iypnb file along with dataset.
- Recommended IDE is [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), you can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- If you are unable to import .iypnb file or the file is not supported. Then create a new .iypnb file.
- Copy the codes line by line from the singlecodefile.py for the respective Dataset and Notebook file.
