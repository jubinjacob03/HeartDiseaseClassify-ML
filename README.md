# HeartDiseaseClassify-ML
Heart Disease Dataset Analysis &amp; Classification using  Machine Learning models such as linear regression, support vector machine, k-means, k-nearest neighbors and logistic regression  to predict cardiac diseases.

# Main Branch
- This branch contains all files for both branches [heartD-1](https://github.com/jubinjacob03/HeartDiseaseClassify-ML/tree/heartD-1) & [heartD-2](https://github.com/jubinjacob03/HeartDiseaseClassify-ML/tree/heartD-1)
- Machine Learning with different Regressions on different Dataset
- Branch <em>heartD-1 
</em> -

      HD_Linear-Reg.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with python code.
      Heart Disease.csv: Dataset of Heart Disease in which Machine Learning was performed.
      heartD-1_singlecodefile.py: Single .py file which contains all python codes from notebook file (for easy copying of codes).

- Branch <em>heartD-2 
</em> -

      HD2_Logistic,KNN,SVM-Reg.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with python code.
      heart disease classification dataset.csv: Dataset of Heart Disease in which Machine Learning was performed.
      heartD-2_singlecodefile.py: Single .py file which contains all python codes from notebook file (for easy copying of codes).



# Setup and Running

- Install Any IDE which supports .ipynb and .py format.
- Import the .iypnb file along with dataset for respective branch (Check branch details to understand file structure for [each branch](#main-branch))
- Recommended IDE is [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), you can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- If you are unable to import .iypnb file or the file is not supported. Then create a new .iypnb file.
- Copy the codes line by line from the singlecodefile.py for the respective Dataset and Notebook file.
